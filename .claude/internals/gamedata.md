# Game data sources, data sets, extraction

### Game data sources, extraction, desktop, releases (`src/gamedata/`, `desktop/`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`)

Both loaders fetch every file through `gamedata/source.ts#fetchAsset`, which resolves the session's
`AssetSource` once (`resolveAssetSource`, shared promise; `resetAssetSource` / `setAssetSource` after
Help ▸ Game Data… changes it) by running `locateGameData(deps)` — a pure chain over injected probes
(`tests/gamedata.test.ts` pins the order): **bundled** (`BASE_URL` + `tileset/manifest.json` or
`unit/manifest.json` answers JSON — a dev server answers index.html with 200, hence the parse), **stored**
(`store.ts`: the OPFS copy under `gamedata/` with a `stamp.json` written last; a memory `Map` when there is
no OPFS), **desktop** (`window.scmjsDesktop.gameData.locate()`, then it is bundled again — the source carries
`desktop: true`), **none**. There is deliberately no fifth step: the configured web address
(`VITE_GAME_DATA_URL` and a `gameDataUrl` preference over it, serving an extracted tree or the two archives)
was **removed** along with `installFromUrl`, the `remote` source kind and the CI variable — nothing is
fetched from an address the user did not name, and the chain running out and asking is easier to explain
than four ways of not being asked. The preload's first task is the resolution (progress on the splash for a
desktop extraction); `usePreload` mirrors the source into `gameDataSourceAtom` and opens the `gameData`
dialog with `{ auto: true }` when it ends at none. After an install the dialog calls `retryFailedParts`
(drops the `LazyFiles` nulls) / `retryTilesetParts` and bumps `gameDataRevisionAtom`, which `useTileset` /
`useUnitAssets` depend on — that is how a map already open picks the graphics up. It also calls
`useMapFileActions.ts#relayBlankTerrain`: the startup map was laid by `flatTerrain` with no CV5 to pick
variations from, so every pair took variation 0 — invisible under flat colours, and one megatile repeated
across the map the moment the graphics land. `newMapInto` records that fill in `blankFillAtom`
(`gameDataAtoms.ts`, cleared by `loadDocumentAtom` / `closeDocumentAtom`) and the relay lays the tiles and
ISOM again in place, leaving the map unmodified; it refuses once the map has been edited or has a path, so
a file's own terrain is never touched. `tests/blank-fill.test.ts`.

**Data sets** (`gamedata/profiles.ts`, `services/gameData.ts`): the editor draws from one set of
game files at a time, and a `GameDataProfile` (id + name) names it — `DEFAULT_PROFILE` is the game's
own; any other is a mod's, the same formats with files replaced, installed under its id
(`installDataSet`: the game's two archives required, the mod's archives and loose files laid over
them through `readerFor`'s overlay; `splitPickedFiles` turns a picked folder into that) and stored
under `gamedata-profiles/<id>/` beside the game's `gamedata/` (`store.ts#profileDir`, every store
function takes the id, `listStoredCopies`). The choice is `scmjs.gameData` (`gameDataProfileAtom`,
in `STORED_RESETS`; the resolver reads the key itself through `activeProfileId` since it runs
outside the store) and the chain asks for the chosen set's copy first, falling back to the game's
own with a note in `tried`. `AssetSource.profile` says which set answered. Switching is
`switchDataSet`: everything decoded describes the old files under the same ids, so it drops the lot
(`resetUnitAssets`, `releaseAllTilesets`, `clearFrameCache`, `clearComposedImages`), resolves again
and bumps `gameDataRevisionAtom` — `useUnitAssets` now re-reads `peekUnitAssets` on every bump
rather than keeping what it had. `api.gameData` and the `"gameData"` event are the plugin side
(`host.ts#gameDataApi`). A data set is a name over files in the game's formats: the table sizes,
tileset formats and CHK layouts are the game's, and a mod that extends them is out of scope.

**Names from the data** (`data/gameNames.ts`): `stat_txt.tbl` (entries 0–227 the unit types as
`Name\0Subname\0Category`, read by `decodeTblEntries`; the `label` columns of `weapons.dat` /
`upgrades.dat` / `techdata.dat` point into it, now decoded) gives the game's own names; the editor's
tables are StarEdit's. The rule is per entry: the data's name where it differs from what the
game's own data says for that id, StarEdit's elsewhere — so Blizzard's files change nothing and a
mod's renames show. `GAME_*` there are the game's names where they differ from StarEdit's,
generated from the real files and pinned in `tests/names.test.ts`; `namesFromAssets` builds a
`LoadedNames` (null per slot where the table stands) that `units/load.ts` installs through
`installNames` when the tables arrive, and `unitName` / `weaponName` / `upgradeName` / `techName`
read it first, so every caller follows. `UNIT_NAMES` stays the text trigger format's vocabulary;
`unitByName` accepts the loaded names too. Lists built once at import were the trap here: the
palette's and the settings dialogs' item lists are built per render or on the revision now.
(`UPGRADE_NAMES` had Plasma Shields at 7 where `upgrades.dat` has it at 15; fixed, with
`UPGRADE_RACE`.)

`GameDataDialog.tsx` shows one thing at a time: with data it is a status line ("Now") and Remove copy;
without, the status line is replaced by a caution notice (`.gd-alert`) saying what the editor cannot draw,
because flat colours and coloured markers read as broken rather than unconfigured, and the two routes are
weighted rather than listed — the download is a card (`.gd-card`) carrying the one large button
(`.gd-cta`), the user's own archives the quieter `.gd-alt` under it, and the footer says "Continue without
graphics" so leaving is a choice rather than a dismissal. **Download from Blizzard** (`install.ts#installFromZipUrl` over `BLIZZARD_ZIP_URL`) reads
Blizzard's own free StarEdit package — which carries trimmed StarDat/BrooDat that extract to the same 931
files a 1.16 install does, byte for byte, provided the `patch_rt.mpq` in the same zip is left alone (it
changes seven tables). `zip.ts` is the pure part: a `RangeReader` (`httpRangeReader` over `fetch`, with an
`onProgress` that streams so an 82 MB member does not freeze the bar), `readZipDirectory` (EOCD then the
central directory, Zip64 reported rather than misread), `readZipMember` (the *local* header is measured
rather than trusting the directory's copy of its extra field, then `DecompressionStream("deflate-raw")`)
and `findMembers` (by base name, ignoring folder and case). Only 82 MB of the 101 MB zip is transferred and
no zip library is needed; `tests/zip.test.ts` drives it all over a zip built in the test. It goes through
`github.com/scm-js/cloudflare-blizzard-forwarder`, a Cloudflare Worker at `gamedata.scmjs.dev` that adds
the CORS header and forwards ranges, because `download.blizzard.com` serves a `*.cloudfront.net`
certificate, plain HTTP is mixed content, and no route there sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`; the
desktop uses the same address, its renderer being an ordinary page. The second route is **files / folder**
(`installFromFiles` → `extract.worker.ts`, which writes the OPFS copy with sync access handles — the one
write path every browser has, worker-only — or posts the files back for `keepInMemory`) with the desktop's
search / folder picker beside it. The desktop's Remove resolves again with `{ search: false }` so it does
not extract the same files straight back.

`extract.ts` is the extraction itself, pure and dependency-free apart from `iscript.ts` (`.ts` import
specifiers on purpose: Node's type stripping runs it), producing the exact bytes and manifests the old
scripts wrote — `scripts/extract-*.mjs` are thin wrappers now, `archives.ts` is the mopaq side. Never
redistribute what it produces: the forwarder passes Blizzard's own download through and keeps nothing, and
no build ships game data or an address to fetch it from.
