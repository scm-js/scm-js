# Terrain editing

### Terrain editing (`src/editor/terrain.ts`, `src/hooks/useTerrainTools.ts`)

Edits are **invertible change lists** (`TileChange { at, before, after }`). Brush functions
(`stampTile`, `stampTerrain`, `floodRegion`, …) are pure: they compute changes without touching the
scenario. `applyChanges(scn, changes, "do" | "undo")` applies them and marks `MTXM` + `TILE` dirty.
`useTerrainTools` applies changes live during a drag (bumping the revision so the canvas repaints) and
calls `commitEditAtom` once on mouse-up so the whole stroke is one undo entry (200 levels). `ISOM` is
intentionally left untouched by the Rect/Tile brushes, matching SCMDraft's non-isometric modes.

Symmetry (`src/editor/symmetry.ts`, `symmetryAtom`): `mirrorRect` / `mirrorIndices` turn a brush
footprint or flood region into the set of cells including its images, and the Rect / Tile / Fog
brushes run their normal stamp over that set — so pairs still come from column parity and `Stroke`
needs no extra merging. Square-only modes (rot90, diag, adiag) act as `none` on non-square maps
(`symmetryAvailable`). The continuous versions cover objects: `mirrorPixel` (a unit's or sprite's
centre — `useUnitTools` / `useSpriteTools` expose `ghostsAt` and place every image the checks
accept), `mirrorBox` (a location's bounds, `useLocationTools.create`) and `mirrorTileRect` (a
doodad footprint; `keepsShape` drops an image that would turn a non-square one). The isometric
brush paints the diamond under each image of the pointer (`paintIsomAt`). Blend, moving and
deleting are deliberately not covered. The viewport draws the axes on every layer but the
clipboard and draws the mirrored ghosts fainter; `tests/symmetry.test.ts`.

Replace Terrain (`terrain.ts#replaceTerrain` / `matchingTiles`, `useTerrainTools.replace`,
`ReplaceTerrainDialog` in `dialogs/TerrainDialogs.tsx`) swaps a `TerrainPick` — a flat terrain by
ISOM id (matched by CV5 group index like the Rect fill) or one exact tile — for another over the
map or the marked area, through `stampTerrain` / `stampTile`; one undo step, ISOM untouched.

The Isometric brush lives in `src/editor/isom.ts` — a port of Chkdraft's reverse-engineering of StarEdit
(MIT). Read its header comment first. Key facts: the ISOM section is a lattice of diamonds whose values
index a per-tileset *shape-link table* built from the CV5 at load time (`isomTables`, cached per
`Tileset`), plus the copied-in terrain numbering/adjacency in `src/data/isomTables.ts` (an ISOM value is
**not** a CV5 index — `isomValueOf(era, index)` maps between them). `paintIsom` mutates `scn.tiles`
*and* `scn.isom` and returns `{ tiles, isom }` change lists; `HistoryEntry.isom` carries the second list
through undo/redo (`applyIsomChanges`). `hasIsom(scn)` gates the brush: a map without `ISOM` gets a
notice pointing at the Repair plugin; the rebuild itself (`rebuildIsomFromTiles`) is reached only through
`tx.rebuildIsom` on the plugin API — there is no native button or menu item — and creating the section is
the `createdIsom` history case (`commitEditAtom` bumps `isomRevisionAtom` for it). `isomReport` /
`STALE_ISOM_SHARE` live in `editor/isom.ts`; `useIsomStatus` and `api.terrain.checkIsom` both read them
(computed on load, not per stroke). `checkIsom` measures **lattice → tiles**: does the lattice reproduce
the tiles that are there. That is *not* the question a rebuild answers, and reporting it alone was a bug
worth remembering: `rebuildIsomFromTiles` votes a lattice out of the tiles, converges in **one** pass,
and leaves behind every rect no lattice can produce — hand-placed tiles, blends, another editor's
ground. Measured over the fixture maps with Rect blocks stamped on, a rebuild took 5–34% disagreement
down to a residue of 2–13% and a second rebuild changed nothing, so a map with hand-laid terrain warned
"ISOM stale (14%)" and recommended a repair that could not move the number, for ever — the Repair
plugin re-ticked it after every press. So `isomReport` runs the rebuild too and answers `inherent`
(the rects it would leave) beside `mismatched`, and **`stale` is what a rebuild would recover**:
`(mismatched - inherent) / rects > STALE_ISOM_SHARE`. The palette badge, its hint, Check Map and the
plugin all read `stale`, and say the leftover is nobody's to fix rather than offering a repair for it.
It deliberately does **not** report how many lattice values a rebuild would write: that number sounds
like the answer and is not — a rebuild rewrites 500–3000 values on a Blizzard map that measures 0%
mismatched, since a different row can mean the same thing. Cost: `checkIsom` is ~2 ms on a 256 × 256
map and the rebuild ~75, so `isomReport` returns on the check alone when `mismatched` is 0, which is
every map StarEdit and this editor write; `rebuildIsomFromTiles` keys its inverse-link table by number
rather than by a template string, which is 131k lookups on that map (89 → 73 ms). `tests/isom.test.ts` validates all of this against the fixture maps; keep those
tests green when touching the CV5 decoder (`edges`, `stack`) or the tables.

Terrain-type ids in the palette are CV5 group indices of flat tile pairs (the same ids `ISOM` stores).
Rect mode paints in left/right pairs following map column parity, sharing one random variation per
pair — the tests in `tests/terrain-edit.test.ts` pin this behaviour.

The Blend brush (`src/editor/blend.ts`) is pixel-based: `edgeTable` lifts every megatile's four
outermost pixel strips straight from the VR4 (cached per `Tileset` in a WeakMap, ~40 ms once), and
`blendCandidates(tileset, anchorId, side)` ranks `drawableTiles` (one id per megatile) by
`edgeDistance` between the anchor's side and the candidate's *opposite* side — mean |ΔRGB| over the
32 pixels, 0..255; designed L/R pairs measure 0.2–8, so `DEFAULT_BLEND_OPTIONS.maxDistance` is 16.
The mode does not stroke: `paintsTiles("blend")` is false, a click on the map is `pickAt` setting
`blendAnchorAtom` (map coordinates, read back through `scenarioAtom` + `terrainRevisionAtom` so the
listed tile follows undo), and the palette's `tools.blendAt(side, id)` is the only writer —
`placeBlend` on the neighbour cell, committed through `commitTerrain`, then the anchor moves onto it
when `blendFollowAtom` is set. `tests/blend.test.ts` pins the edge extraction (including the minitile
flip bit), ranking and placement against a synthetic tileset and the designed seams of the real ones.
