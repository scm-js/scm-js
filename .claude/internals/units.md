# Units

### Units (`src/formats/dat/`, `src/formats/units/`, `src/editor/units.ts`, `src/hooks/useUnitTools.ts`)

`dat.ts` decodes only the fields the editor needs from the Brood War `arr\*.dat` layout (struct of
arrays; placement box / add-on offset / extents are arrays of structs — the layout is pinned by
`tests/dat.test.ts` against the real file). `units/load.ts` fetches the tables once (`getUnitAssets` /
`peekUnitAssets`) and GRPs lazily (`requestGrp`, `onGrpLoaded` fires so canvases repaint);
`units/sprites.ts` caches one canvas per (image, frame, colour row, tileset palette) in an
`LruCache` (`src/lib/lru.ts`, budgeted in pixel bytes — `FRAME_CACHE_BUDGET`, 64 MB — since
frames range from 8² to 256²; evicted canvases are zero-sized so the bitmap goes at once;
`frameCacheUsage()` reads it; `tests/lru.test.ts`). Team colour =
`tunit.pcx` row `playerColorIndex(scn.playerColors, owner)` (COLR-aware) remapping palette indices
8–15, painted through the *tileset* palette — so sprites need the tileset loaded too. `unitName(id)` and
`UNIT_GROUPS` (ids, not names) live in `src/data/units.ts`; `activeUnitAtom` is a units.dat id.
The special ids have one home each and nothing else may spell them out: `data/units.ts#START_LOCATION`
is 214 (`editor/placement.ts`, `documentAtoms`'s `START_LOCATION_UNIT` and the bare ids in
`services/preload.ts` / `editor/statistics.ts` were four more copies of it) and `editor/units.ts` owns
`MINERAL_FIELD_IDS` / `VESPENE_GEYSER` / `DEFAULT_MINERALS` / `DEFAULT_GAS` beside `isResource`. Plugins
get the lot through `api.consts` rather than writing the numbers again.

Edits are `UnitChange { index, before, after }` lists (insert / remove / replace, removals highest index
first) carried in `HistoryEntry.units`; `applyUnitChanges` marks `UNIT` dirty. `unitsRevisionAtom` is the
repaint trigger for unit changes (the list is mutated in place, like tiles); `selectedUnitsAtom` holds
indices and is cleared by any unit edit/undo. `snapPlacement` is the palette's *Snap to grid*: on, anything
with the Building flag goes on the tile grid by its placement box and everything else on the nearest
tile centre; off, both land at the pointer. It snaps the *destination*, so `moveUnits` brings a unit
that sits off the grid back onto it rather than preserving its offset. `makeUnit` writes
StarEdit-style valid/used masks (see `tests/unit-edit.test.ts`). The viewport draws in `drawOrder` (ground by y, then flyers) and falls back to
coloured markers while a GRP loads or when the assets are missing. The UNIT bit masks (`UnitValid`,
`UnitUsed`, `UnitState`, `UnitRelation`) live in `sections/objects.ts`; `UnitPropertiesDialog` edits every
record field on the selection (payload `{ indices }`), writing only touched fields via `updateSelected`.

Placement (`src/editor/placement.ts`): `checkPlacement` applies the palette's `placementOptionsAtom`
(collision = overlapping collision boxes of non-flyers; terrain = buildable tiles under a building's
placement box / walkable VF4 minitiles under a unit's collision box) — `useUnitTools.ghostAt` carries the
verdict, `placeAt` and `endDrag` refuse on it. `strandedUnits` finds units a terrain edit invalidated;
`useTerrainTools.commitTerrain` removes them in the *same* `HistoryEntry` (`changes` + `units`) when
`removeStranded` is on. `unitPlacingAtom` is the "armed" state: the palette arms it, Esc / right-click
(`stopPlacing`) disarm it, and only then does a click on empty ground place.

Animation (`src/formats/dat/iscript.ts`, `lo.ts`, `src/formats/units/animate.ts`): `iscript.ts` is
dependency-free so `scripts/extract-units.mjs` can import it under Node's type stripping and walk the
scripts for reachable images (`walkAnimation`, `IMAGE_SPAWN_OPS`). `UnitAnimator` keeps one `SpriteState`
per record (matched by object, then by serial across replacements), each a bottom-to-top `images` stack
running Init → StarEditInit (turreted vehicles) or Built (buildings); `tick()` is one game frame and the
viewport's rAF loop drives it alongside water cycling (`GAME_FRAME_MS`), repainting only when `tick()`
reports a change and units are on screen. Damage overlays (image 450/472 + the damage `.lo` slot index — the
22 slots are laid out Terran 0–7, Zerg 8–15, Protoss 16–21 — count from `hitPointsPercent`) are re-evaluated in `sync`; `creategasoverlays` spawns smoke
from the special `.lo`. `sprites.ts#getImageFrame` is the per-(image, frame, flip, colour, tileset)
canvas cache; shadows draw as 50% black, `DrawFunction.Remap` images through the tileset's
`<name>.<ofire|gfire|bfire|bexpl>.pcx` table (column 0, blended "lighter"). Anything that needs the
running game (attacks, sounds, projectile sprites, condition jumps) is a no-op. `tests/iscript.test.ts`
and `tests/animate.test.ts` run against the real files when `public/` is populated.
